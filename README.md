## `Developers and Contributors`

### `Requirements`

To contribute to development, you will need to download and install the required software first.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/) - We are using C# 7.0 code so Visual Studio 2017 is required to compile. Visual Studio 2015 or older will not be able to compile the code.
- [.NET 4.7 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170&desc=dotnet47)

### `Cloning Source Code`

Next, you need to get the source code.  This source code repository uses git submodules. So when you clone the source code, you will need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Furtif/Account-Manager.git
```

Or if you already cloned without the recursive option, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Furtif/Account-Manager.git
cd Account-Manager
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

 You can contribute in many ways, here are some that you can do to help the project out!
